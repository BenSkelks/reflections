How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Minimalized the text that needed to be reviewed.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Lets you find all changes easily and see how the program developed over time.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Con: you might forget to make a version. Pro: no need for keeping versions that are not needed. You decide when a commit should be made and thereby mark important changes.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    A doc is normally a single, complete piece of information. Whereas Git is for multiple files that work together as one complete unit.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Find the relevant commits with log and compare with diff.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You can easily restore previous versions before your changes screwed everything up.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Eating kebab
