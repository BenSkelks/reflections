When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When you need to access it from different devices or other people also
    work on it.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    You might be working on something that may become a different branch.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks: cloning branches in github. Clones - starting point for working and
    collaborating on projects. Branch - the development of the project.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    Allows you to compare what's been by others with your own work.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Harder: making sure all collborators get and check your changes.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    It distinguishes between a specific branch and the one you want to add something
    to. Allows others to work freely on the main branch.
